# app_Script_Add_On
This is a Google app script add on that works with a private specific spreadsheet in Google docs.
It itereates the sheet, grabs the necessary data & wraps that data with the code that is needed. 
That code is then pasted into an XML object. This is a project within my current employment.

Google app script uses Javascript, though with some slightly unexpected results within this environment(Google servers) 
- this is to be confirmed - some iterations are verbose in this script due to JS code executing differently in this 
environment.
